### Description:
RSS is a specialized format for describing news feeds, article announcements, and other materials. This is the easiest way for websites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe to changes. For this, special services called RSS aggregators are used. These services are able to poll the RSS feeds of sites for new posts and display them in a convenient way, marking what they have read and so on.

Rss Reader is a service for aggregating RSS feeds, with the help of which it is convenient to read various sources, such as blogs. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them itself and adds new entries to the general feed.
